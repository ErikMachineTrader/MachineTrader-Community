# MachineTrader-Community
This is a community repository for MachineTrader users who want to share json files that can be uploaded in the MachineTrader instances and used to execute algorithmic trading strategies. 

"SPY 1 second to sqlite.json" - This json script connects with the Polygon.io data engine and downloads the last trade for the ticker SPY each second. Like most MachineTrader scripts, this file is entirely customizable a MachineTrader low-code, no-code instance. The script will download any equity ticker or crypto pair. It creates and stores the data in a sqlite table. The rate of downloads is customizabel as well.
